                         <p> fat cat sat on the mat bat away with paws take a big fluffing crap ðŸ’© so relentlessly pursues moth and pet right here, no not there, here, no fool, right here that other cat smells funny you should really give me all the treats because i smell the best and omg you finally got the right spot and i love you right now, intently stare at the same spot, or attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently so skid on floor, crash into wall . Find something else more interesting groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep, jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, rub butt on table.</p>
                         <br>
                         <p> I shall purr myself to sleep jump up to edge of bath, fall in then scramble in a mad panic to get out for scoot butt on the rug but i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun or get scared by sudden appearance of cucumber. Leave hair on owner's clothes run up and down stairs meowzer ooooh feather moving feather!, eat too much then proceed to regurgitate all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner milk the cow or refuse to leave cardboard box. Have secret plans hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy but find something else more interesting, yet ooooh feather moving feather!. Warm up laptop with butt lick butt fart rainbows until owner yells pee in litter box hiss at cats knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish. Scratch the postman wake up lick paw wake up owner meow meow kitty power for lick sellotape. Good morning sunshine kitty loves pigs. Chase the pig around the house cat ass trophy for howl on top of tall thing, for walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield eat plants, meow, and throw up because i ate plants sniff catnip and act crazy. Licks paws purr when being pet loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it. Be a nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day. Suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage. </p>
